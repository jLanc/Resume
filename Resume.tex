\makelettertitle

I submit my application for the opportunity to be considered for the position of \jListing{} which was advertised on the\cName{} website. As a highly motivated Honours graduate with proven abilities in problem solving and innovation, I am confident my experience and knowledge will enable me to contribute greatly to the role within the organisation.

I completed Honours in Computer Science at Flinders University, South Australia in June 2019, following my completion of a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Certificates II and III in IT and Networking at TAFE.

Over the past five years, I have provided a wide range of IT technical support to businesses and customers, working on servers, networks, and personal computers. Furthermore, I have experience in innovation through designing, developing, and implementing cutting-edge malware detection methods.

The title of my Honours thesis is ``Serval Mesh Observer - Building an observation network to monitor and mature existing Serval Mesh Extender devices''. It involved adapting a portable internet router to monitor and report Wi-Fi and UHF activity simultaneously in the C language, on niche telecommunication devices.

My software development experience includes but is not limited to the following:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Github, Bitbucket
    \item C, C++, C\#
    \item Java, Python, Prolog
    \item SQL, XML, HTML, Javascript
    \item Bash Scripting (Linux + Windows)
    \item Windows Powershell
    \item Xcode, Netbeans, Visual Studio
    \item Linux Makefiles
    \item Azure DevOps
    \item OpenWrt
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

In particular, my Honours thesis work has taught me a vast range of skills with Linux and C, focusing on serial execution for low-powered devices.

I look forward to hearing from you soon. I can be contacted via the details above.

Please note that I am currently located in Australia, however, I hold dual UK citizenship and will be permanently relocating to the UK on 8 September 2019.
